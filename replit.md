# Project_LANTERN

## Overview
This is a GitHub import from https://github.com/pankhuri0209/Project_LANTERN.

## Current State
The repository was imported on December 7, 2025, and currently contains:
- Only a README.md file with the project name
- No source code, dependencies, or configuration files
- No build system or package manager files

## Project Status
This appears to be an empty repository scaffold. No application code has been added yet, so there is nothing to run or configure in the Replit environment at this time.

## Next Steps
To make this project functional, you would need to:
1. Decide what type of application to build (web app, CLI tool, etc.)
2. Choose a technology stack (Node.js, Python, etc.)
3. Add source code and dependencies
4. Configure build and run scripts
